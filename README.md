## SMFile_Parser
#### Stepmania File Parser for the [Stepmania Note Generator](https://github.com/cpuguy96/stepmania-note-generator) by cpuguy96 for [Stepmania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm) by VR0. Used with [Stepmania File Writer](https://github.com/jhaco/SMTXT_Converter) by me

- Parses all .sm files in ```parseIn``` folder generated by smfile_parser for the following information:
  - Title
  - BPM
  - Note Timings (in seconds)
  - Note Placements (ex. 0001, 0201, etc)
- Writes processed data to their respective .txt files for successfully parsed .sm files in the ```parseOut``` folder.

Supports files with static BPM for the purpose of training the note generator program.\
Only reads the first difficulty listed (plans to read and output multiple difficulties TBA)

#### usage:

- Run the script to generate both folders.
- Copy the Stepmania song folders (NOT THE PACK FOLDER) into the ```parseIn``` folder and run the script.
- Successfully parsed files will be generated in the ```parseOut``` folder.

#### changelog (top-new):
- refactored code for readability with changes from cpuguy96 for file management
- added a check for .sm files with static BPM and ignores files with changing BPM
- changed "#KEYSOUNDS" checks to "#NOTES", it's basically the same thing
- corrected from 1/192th notes to 1/256th notes
- added offset timings (if present) resulting in more accurate translations
- added an error message to print the offending file name
- included hold (2) and roll (3) note types
- changed from binary/decimal note notation to copying the numeric combination for each valid note from the .sm file
- fixed a bug where the Step.note and Step.types were not cleared if errors occured while parsing a previous file
- cleaned up code for readability
- added formatting to .ogg files found within the directory
- added example vanessa .sm, .txt and .ogg files
- fixed a bug where the parser skipped the last measure
- replaced holds with normal note for note placement
- added note placement for each note timing as a binary to decimal function, ignores mines
- fixed a bug where the Step lists were not cleared after each file, resulting in abnormally large and incorrect output files
- added exception handling to continue to the next file if the current one throws an error
- converted to a no-input, batch processing method for .sm files found within the directory
- added formatting to output .txt file names
- ignores non-ASCII (ex. Japanese) text in the title

#### plans:
- create windows batch file to run the python script, just have to edit inputs (is there a difference?)
- ~~full rewrite of code for readability and ease of modification.~~
- ~~be able to convert the resultant .txt file back to a usable .sm file~~ [here](https://github.com/jhaco/SMTXT_Converter)
- be able to parse all difficulties included in the target .sm file
- ~~be able to check .sm files for static BPM and only parse those~~

#### issues:
- some .sm files that should work does not, throwing a divide by zero exception
- a single file had been renamed incorrectly, unsure of what caused this
